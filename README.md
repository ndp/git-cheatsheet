Standalone HTML page that organizes Git's commands by what they affect.
Built as I was learning git and trying to understand it. It's proved useful
to others in the same endeavor.

Comments and pull requests welcome.

## To add a translation

1. Determine the 2-letter language code (ISO 639-1). See the existing files in `git-cheatsheet/lang`.
2. Create a new JSON file with the name of the code in `git-cheatsheet/lang`. Choose one of the other languages as a starting point.
3. Write your translation. Use the exact identical property keys in the JSON structure. Only change the values.
4. Add a link for users to choose the translation. In `git-cheatsheet.html`, insert (alphabetically) a new line that looks like:
```
<a class="lang" data-lang="vi" data-docs="Vietnamese translation by trgiangdo">vn</a>
```
5. Add your name to the README.md above.
6. Test manually
7. Create a pull request. Give me a couple days to reply, but then feel free to write.
8. Once it's merged, tell people about it.

Keep the PR restricted to changes related to the translation.

## FAQ

### Are there any "features"?

You can navigate over different "locations" and commands with the mouse, arrow keys, or vi-like keystrokes.

### Why is it called "Cheat Sheet"?

It's pretty silly, actually. I had a little SEO juice from a couple other real cheat sheets,
so I thought I'd just leverage that term. In retrospect, I think this was an
okay tactic, as it brought people to the page.
