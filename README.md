Standalone HTML page that organizes Git's commands by what they affect.
Built as I was learning git and trying to understand it. It's proved useful
to others in the same endeavor.

## Development

I'm in the process of moving the source code into modern JS, and
using `babel` to transpile it. New files are in the `src` folder, and using `yarn build` to transpile.

CI is on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ndp/git-cheatsheet)

## FAQ

### Are there any "features"?

You can navigate over different "locations" and commands with the mouse, arrow keys, or vi-like keystrokes.

### Why is it called "Cheat Sheet"?

It's pretty silly, actually. I had a little SEO juice from a couple other real cheat sheets,
so I thought I'd just leverage that term. In retrospect, I think this was an
okay tactic, as it brought people to the page.
